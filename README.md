# InputSystem (Utility for modders)
Universal Input system for modders where you can register different type of actions to be done for spcific input types (click, double click, hold and hold released) action to register into their own inputhandling. don't have to check if it's been activated as this system will tell you when it happened.

As of now because it won't trigger click if you hold and won't trigger hold if clicked, so it can feel slightly delayed.
this behaviour is purposely made to mimic game behaviour that can't be combined
